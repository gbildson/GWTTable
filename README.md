## What is GWTTable?
GWTTable is a fully capable poker table for multiple player use across the web.  The front-end handles display and the state is getting computed on the server. Events are sent to the client as required.  Multiple users can join the table and participate.  

The link above should give a running example of the table in a non-interactive mode.  The interactive system requires some work.  I originally wrote this code in 2008/2009.   I have earlier versions that have a pure Java/Swing front-end.

Structurally, this code is a google web toolkit wrapper around some of my poker code and poker game services.
